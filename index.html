            <p>This is a beginner guide about all games made by Suda51 that are commonly agreed to be part of the "Kill
                the Past" series. All of them share the same continuity and similar themes that make up the backbone of
                Suda's entire lifework in his 27+ year old carrer. It commonly focuses on the idea of the past being a
                burden that needs to be overcome in order to face the future. It also has themes such as political
                corruption, rampant urban development, existencial anguish and the threat of data collection.</p>

            <h1>¿WHAT IS KILL THE PAST?</h1>
            <p>Kill the Past is a series of games with similar thematic tones or directly connected to a shared
                universe. It depicts characters in various walks of life who refuse or are either unable to let go of
                their past in ways that catch up to them without fail. In Kill the Past, to refuse to face your past is
                to die. Unable to move on, unable to understand, it is akin to live in a constant purgatory. Facing your
                past is the most difficult and most important part of a person’s life. It acknowledges the understanding
                of your self, your struggles, your fears, and your hopes. The past becomes the missing link that bridges
                every facet of a person’s identity. It is then quite on point that the work of the western fandom to
                piece things together is to face Suda51’s past head-on.</p>
            <p>But Kill the Past is still a bit more than that, it represents a lot of punk essence of Suda and the
                Grasshopper company. Its dadaist inspirations shine through all these games, many of them being
                counter-culture, defying established conventions through the writing but also as a game, and carrying an
                overall sense of anti-capitalism. Common themes revolve around political corruption, rampant urban
                development and its consequences like the breaking down of communities for a more individualistic
                society both at a professional and personal level.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A lot of these elements and themes find their main inspiration through Suda’s own life as described in
                his biography. Starting as an only child from a single mother in an era of Japan where divorce was still
                heavily frowned upon, from the loneliness of his youth, his emancipation through music and pop culture
                as well as the various jobs he has taken early in his adult life from handbag designer to door-to-door
                salesman to funeral service worker. These are all events of his life that ends up coming back in his
                games in one way or another. He is someone who lived in the urban transformation of Japan, from the
                then-rural Nagano to the life in Tokyo where the vastness of the city is only matched by the intense
                loneliness it brings.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="bio">
                <img src="img/suda51.jpg" alt="suda51">
                Kill the Past becomes a theme that applies as much to its creator than it does to the characters he
                creates. An ensemble of characters where each of them represents a specific part of Suda’s life that
                struggles to find a meaning that could exist but is futile to search for. The answer, then, is to learn
                to face what’s behind you in order to finally move forward. To process what kind of person you are, and
                to learn what kind of person you want to be. As such, his way of processing it becomes inherently
                postmodernistic, as if purposefully avoiding what has been done in order to find his own answers through
                paths that none has taken before. Grasshopper’s games are never strictly one genre, they blend together,
                sometimes bringing something new, sometimes bringing something old, in order to seek their answers in
                new and unpredictable ways, as if they themselves are going with the currents, and checking out what is
                beyond the hill next to the branch they managed to latch on to.

            <h1>THE SUDAVERSE</h1>
            <p>The connection between the Kill the Past games always brought the question of whether or not there was a
                broader universe shared by all of Grasshopper’s games. This question was always teased but never
                confirmed, that is until Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes. The release of this game brought the
                Sudaverse to the forefront, making many games linked together whether or not they are part of the Kill
                the Past series, even the ever-elusive Killer7. Examples of non-KTP games that are part of the broader
                Sudaverse (and as such part of the same timeline) are: Shadows of the Damned, Killer is Dead, Diabolical
                Pitch and Michigan: Report from Hell. Some are a definite and accepted part of the universe, some others
                might be more debatable and potentially offer alternate versions that fits the universe more, but all of
                these are accepted to be a part of the Sudaverse in one way or another.</p>
